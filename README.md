## 🎨 Theme & State Management

The app uses a simple `ThemeProvider` based on `ChangeNotifier` to switch between `light` and `dark` modes globally:

```dart
ChangeNotifierProvider(
  create: (_) => ThemeProvider(),
  child: Consumer<ThemeProvider>(
    builder: (context, provider, _) {
      return MaterialApp(
        themeMode: provider.themeMode,
        theme: ThemeData.light(),
        darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(),
        ...
      );
    },
  ),
)
```

---

## 🔗 Navigation

Named routing is used for easy screen transitions:

```dart
routes: {
  '/home': (context) => HomeScreen(...),
  '/chat': (context) => ChatScreen(),
  '/settings': (context) => SettingsScreen(...),
  ...
}
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

To verify that everything works:
- Navigate through the onboarding to Home
- Toggle dark mode in Settings
- Chat with Maya
- Access profile/counselor/emergency sections

---

## ❓ FAQ

- **Why does dark mode not apply immediately?**  
  Ensure you are using the `themeMode` from the provider in `MaterialApp`.

- **How do I add Firebase or Supabase?**  
  Backend integrations are not yet configured but can be added easily with FlutterFire or Supabase Flutter packages.
